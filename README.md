# takitapart dotfiles 3

## Goals

- Minimal requirements. Ideally a single command in terminal from startup.
- Platform agnostic. Not likely, but would be useful. I use macOS almost exclusively, so I see no practical reason for putting too much effort in this.
- homebrew / gulp. I can easily get 80% of my software installed though these tools.
- Modular.

## Requirements ##

Install the command-line tools.

    xcode-select --install

## Installation ##

Clone the repository.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/takitapart/dotfiles.git

Run the install script.

    cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh
